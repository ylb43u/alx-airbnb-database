## 📝 Instructions

1. **Write an initial query**  
   Retrieve all bookings along with the user details, property details, and payment details.  
   Save this query in `performance.sql`.

2. **Analyze performance**  
   Use `EXPLAIN` to analyze the query’s execution plan.  
   Identify any inefficiencies such as full table scans, costly joins, or missing indexes.

3. **Refactor the query**  
   Improve the query to reduce execution time by:  
   - Removing unnecessary joins  
   - Adding appropriate indexes  
   - Optimizing filters and conditions
